## Progress Report


# Building CNN

- Developed a custom CNN and trained it on both datasets. 
- Saved weights for highest accuracy.

# Exploring Transfer Learning Models

- Trained the following transfer learning models on our datasets;
	- ResNet
	- InceptionV3
	- MobileNetV2
	- VGG16
- The optimal training weights saved for all models. 
# Testing and Metrics of Performance

- Accuracy for different training sizes and models for both datasets have been documented. 
- Currently in the process of testing on real-life images. 

# Work Left

- Building web application and exposing end points for using both recognition and translation. 
- Report writing.
